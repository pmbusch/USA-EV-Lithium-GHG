# The energy, material and carbon handprint of lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles - A US fleet model

Scripts to run the life cycle assessment (LCA) model to estimate fleet level impacts. 

All scripts are numbered in order suggested to run to replicate full results.

* **01-Estimate_Impacts.R**: Master code to estimate LCA impacts based on previously processed parameters (see folder "Prepare-DataInputs").
* **01b-Impacts_GREET.R**: Estimate impacts using GREET model data, only for the supplementary information results. 
* **01c-Impacts_Cambium.R**: Estimate electricty impacts using the Cambium Long Term Marginal Emissions factors, only for the supplementary information results.
